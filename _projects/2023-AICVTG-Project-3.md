The objective is to explore and implement image captioning using a combination of computer vision and natural language processing. The project aims to highlight the challenges in generating textual descriptions for images, emphasize the potential societal and economic benefits, propose a solution with image-based models (Vision Transformer) and language-based models (GPT-2), discuss the complexity compared to traditional computer vision tasks, detail the methodology using the MSCOCO dataset, and evaluate model performance through various image captioning metrics.
