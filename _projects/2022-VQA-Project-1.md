Visual Question Answering (VQA) has piqued the interest of
researchers in deep learning, computer vision, and natural
language processing, a relatively recent challenge in these
fields. VQA requires an algorithm to respond to text-based
inquiries about pictures. Because many open-ended answers
comprise a few words or a closed set of options in a multiple choice format, VQA adapts itself to automated review. We used
the combination of algorithms CNN (for the Image part) and
LSTM/GRU/CNN (for the linguistic part), and a second
algorithm which uses Vision Transformer (ViT)(for the Image
part) and BERT(for the linguistic part).
