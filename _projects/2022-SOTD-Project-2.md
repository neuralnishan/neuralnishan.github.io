This project proposes a **secure online telemedicine dApp (SOTD)** tailored to the constraints of healthcare delivery in Bangladesh.

The architecture combines:

- **Blockchain** for integrity and traceability
- **IPFS** for decentralized document storage
- **Smart contracts** for controlled medical-record workflows
- **Coinbase Commerce** integration for secure payment handling

The system goal is to ensure that sensitive patient records are accessible only to authorized clinicians while maintaining transparency and auditability.
