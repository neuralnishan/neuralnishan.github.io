Telemedicine, a crucial aspect of healthcare, has seen a surge in use due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This technology connects urban doctors with rural patients, reducing the risk of infection. However, Bangladesh faces challenges such as infrastructure, trained healthcare professionals, and limited access to secure technology. To address these issues, a novel telemedicine system is proposed, integrating blockchain technology with an online telemedicine decentralized (SOTD) system and IPFS. This system ensures patient data is only accessible to authorized doctors, and the use of smart contracts automates processes like distributing medical records. The system also integrates with Coinbase Commerce, allowing patients to make secure payments for telemedicine services. This system is reliable, strong, and economical.
